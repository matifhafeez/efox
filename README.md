This report has been built using Microsoft Power BI because of its easy and intuitive user interface. In this report, I have performed various analysis using different visualization techniques. A sample data has been provided which was used to build this report. The purpose of this BI report was to compare the actual sales of the hypothetical company (**efox**) against the forecast figures across different regions. 
You can view the report in Power BI desktop and can verify the DAX (Data Analysis Expression) which I have written against the data.
